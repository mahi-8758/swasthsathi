# Quick Reference: CAPTCHA Setup

## Current Status: ✅ ACTIVE

CAPTCHA authentication is now enabled on your login page!

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### Option 1: Use Demo Key (Development)
- ✅ Already configured in `.env.local`
- ✅ Works immediately
- ⚠️ Shows "This site is using test reCAPTCHA keys"

### Option 2: Use Production Key
Follow these 3 quick steps:

#### Step 1: Create reCAPTCHA Account
```
1. Go: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
2. Click: "Create" or "+"
3. Fill:
   - Label: SWASTH SATHI
   - Type: reCAPTCHA v3
   - Domains: your-domain.com, www.your-domain.com
```

#### Step 2: Copy Your Site Key
```
You'll see two keys after creation:
- Site Key (public) ← COPY THIS
- Secret Key (private) - for backend only
```

#### Step 3: Update Your App
**Development (.env.local):**
```bash
VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_new_site_key_here
```

**Production (Netlify/Vercel):**
```
Go to: Build Settings → Environment Variables
Add: VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = your_new_site_key_here
```

That's it! 🎉
